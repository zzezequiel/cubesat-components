Payload height is flexible as long as the total satellite height does not exceed 1300 mm.\n\nMP42H is highly modular – its configurable subsystems and deployable solar panel configurations can meet your precise mission performance, agility, and power demands.\n\nMP42H bus is highly versatile – its performance capabilities are optimized for remote sensing, high data throughput & complex communications missions, emergency communications, and fundamental research missions. All requiring minimal reconfiguration.\n\nMP42H bus can include a propulsion system that enables the satellite to perform high-impulse maneuvers such as: orbital deployment, orbit maintenance, precision flight in formations, orbit synchronization, and atmospheric drag compensation. This results in an extended satellite orbital lifetime uncovering new opportunities for unique customer missions and significant savings on constellation maintenance costs.",

Also, as an option – M16P configuration for Earth Observation (EO) missions are available.\n\nM16P bus can include a propulsion system capable of performing high-impulse maneuvers such as: orbital deployment, orbit maintenance, precision flight in formations, orbit synchronization and atmospheric drag compensation. This results in an extended satellite orbital lifetime, uncovering new opportunities for unique customer missions and significant savings on constellation maintenance costs.\n\nZZ also offers a single fault tolerant 16U satellite bus design option – M16P-R. By doubling the critical satellite subsystems, single point failures are removed from the system, hence adding mission reliability and redundancy.",

It delivers extended, (up to 11U), payload volume and saves development costs for customers.\n\nThe M12P satellite bus enables customers to concentrate on the most important mission goals and deal only with high-level mission implementation tasks, such as payload development and its support during the mission in orbit.\n\nThe standard configuration of the bus is optimized for IoT, M2M, ADS-B, AIS and other commercial and emergency communication applications as well as scientific and Earth Observation (EO) missions.\n\nZZ also offers a single fault-tolerant 12U satellite bus design option – M12P-R. By doubling the critical satellite subsystems, single point failures are removed from the system, hence adding mission reliability and redundancy.\n\nM12P and M12P-R buses can include a propulsion system capable of performing high-impulse maneuvers such as: orbital deployment, orbit maintenance, precision flight in formations, orbit synchronization and atmospheric drag compensation. This results in an extended satellite orbital lifetime, uncovering new opportunities for unique customer missions and significant savings on constellation maintenance costs.",
